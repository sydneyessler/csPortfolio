## csPortfolio

Hi! Welcome to my portfolio. 

Here I have include all of my work from the year in Advanced Computer Science. In this course, we have focuse on learning about different types of data structures including stacks, queues, and trees. The projects I completed in the course display creativity and my ability to use a variety of different data structures.

# Reflect on all your portfolio projects. 

Of all of my portfolio projects, the two that are my favorite have been Tic-Tac-Toe and Flesch Readability. These two projects challenged me to use new concepts to create programs that allow user interaction. Incorporating ideas and computers science principles that I had just learned helped me to gain confidence in my abilities.

# What is one or two things that are a source of pride in your programming development?  

# Identify them, write about why they are accomplishments, how you did it and what you learned.  Be sure to submit a code snippet along with your writing on the readMe file in your repo.

# Identify the most significant hurdle you encountered last trimester.  Write about what it was and how it was resolved.

# Once you are ready to submit your writing and code examples, study markdown (language used on github to format text).

# Describe the incremental and iterative development process of your included code, focusing on two distinct points in the development process. Describe the difficulties and/ or opportunities you encountered and how they were resolved or incorporated. In your description clearly indicate whether the development described was collaborative or independent. At least one of these points must refer to independent program development.
